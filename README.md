# Hindsight
Previously I created a CRM system for myself and Hindsight was a module for collecting data through forms, surveys, questionaires.

The system was writting using pre-context Phoenix and this is the attempt to refactor and improve the system while also making it open source.

The code you see will include some relics from the original version (especially in the HTML) but for the most part I am trying to cut out anything not strictly needed for the system.
